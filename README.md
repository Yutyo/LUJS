### A simple Node server project for emulating LEGO Universe servers

## Easy

This server is supposed to be the easiest one to set up, at least, that is my goal. I would love to make it to where you could download one thing, run a command, and this just work. I will always keep the setup process as clean and easy as possible.

## Disclaimer

I am a busy person with at least one other LEGO Universe project going on, and this is not the priority.

## Setup

You will need the CDClient.sqlite, which can be found in a couple of places (I will put it up somewhere eventually so it can be included in the project, maybe)

To get it running, download the repository, initialize Node, and it should be almost ready. You will need a maps folder from an extracted client, and to set the mapsFolder config to the path of that folder. The database will be rebuilt on the first run as well. 

## Contributing

I don't plan on anyone else taking interest in this, but if you do, feel free to fork this repository and give it a pull request. I will be happy to look at another person's code if they want to add to this.

## Other notes

I might add more documentation later
